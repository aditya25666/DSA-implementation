## 🧠 DSA Concepts Used

### Merge Intervals

Overlapping meetings are merged into a single continuous interval.

Example:

```
09:00 - 10:00
09:30 - 11:00

↓

09:00 - 11:00
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`

---

### Binary Search

The project is structured to support Binary Search for efficiently locating the insertion position of a meeting in a sorted schedule, enabling optimized conflict detection instead of scanning the entire meeting list.

**Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`
